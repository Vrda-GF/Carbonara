**Carbonara** is a computer-aided engineering software which would make it easier for users to analyse, explore, visualise and simulate various problems regarding these branches of mathematics: applied mathematics and statistics, with an accent on optimization, numerical and regression analysis. In previous version (v1.05) users were able to fit linear, polynomial (n <= 4), exponential, logarithmic and power models to data and compute the quality of the fit. In current version **Numerical Integration** submodule is added, i.e. users are able to approximate an integral using a specified numerical method. More modules coming soon...<br />

Carbonara is __FREE__ to download, use, share... <br />
