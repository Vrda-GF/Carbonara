Carbonara is a computer-aided engineering software which makes it easy for users to analyse, explore, visualise and simulate various problems regarding these branches of mathematics: applied mathematics and statistics, with an accent on optimization, numerical and regression analysis. In current version users are able to fit linear, polynomial (n <= 4), exponential, logarithmic and power models to data and compute the quality of the fit. More modules coming soon...<br />
